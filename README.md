# odin-landing-page

This repo holds my landing page project from the Odin Project. 

For this project I created an entire web page from a design provided (see [full-design.png](full-design.png) and [color-and-fonts.png](color-and-fonts.png)). 

The whole web contains 5 main sections (header, information, quote, signup, and footer). I am implemmenting these sections using the flex layout.

Future Plan:
The page currently adapts well to desktop view using Flexbox. However, its display on smaller screens like mobile phones and tablets needs improvement. I plan to enhance its responsiveness for a better user experience across all device sizes.
